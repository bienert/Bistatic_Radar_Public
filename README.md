## Welcome 
Welcome to *InGlacial*. This repository provides a collection of functions and scripts that make up a novel signal processing chain capable of synchronizing data from an unsynchronized transmitter-receiver pair. *InGlacial* accompanies our ongoing research at the [Stanford Radio-glaciology Lab](https://www.radioglaciology.com/) developing bistatic radar tomography. If you are interested in learning more about the experimental setup, please refer to our [manual for that](https://github.com/bienert/Bistatic_Radar/blob/main/Bienert's%20Bistatic%20Manual.pdf). We hope that this repository can be helpful to you in your research. 


## Contents

#### [Misc](https://github.com/bienert/Bistatic_Radar/tree/main/Misc)
This folder is not a part of the primary signal processing chain. The folder contains scripts we used to produce the reflection coeffecient plots in our paper as well as an example personal packing list for Greenland fieldwork and a Powerpoint with additional processed data from Greenland. 

#### [Processing Scripts](https://github.com/bienert/Bistatic_Radar/tree/main/Processing_Scripts)
This folder contains all of the processing scripts, and example datasets for phase 2 and 3 of the processing chain. A separate ReadMe is provided that describes the processing chain.

#### [Bienert's Bistatic Manual](https://github.com/bienert/Bistatic_Radar/blob/main/Bienert's%20Bistatic%20Manual.pdf)
This manual provides instructions for building the radar hardware
