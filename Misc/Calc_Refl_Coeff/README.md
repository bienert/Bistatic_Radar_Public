# Reflection Coeffecient Calculation ReadMe
Please note that this repository accompanies a paper in review titled "Large Offset Bistatic Radar Sounding of Glaciers using Processing-Based Synchronization".

## Welcome
These scripts calculate the reflection coeffecient as a function of angle and polarization, as shown below.

## Software
All scripts were written in Matlab v2020+. 

## Functions
*'calcReflCoeff_ppol' calculates the reflection coeffecient of P-polarized waves 
*'calcReflCoeff_spol' calculates the reflection coeffecient of S-polarized waves

## Instructions
Open 'main_refl_coeff' and run it.
